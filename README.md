purescript-audiograph
=====================

Highly experimental work in progress.  The idea is to provide a very simple proof of concept to see whether it is realistic to provide a declarative interface into web-audio in purescript - something roughly along the lines of [visual-audio-graph](https://github.com/benji6/virtual-audio-graph).
